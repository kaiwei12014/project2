##Description:
Our project is based on the Bike Sharing Demand problem, which was found on Kaggle (<http://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand>). The objective of this project is to predict the demand of a bike sharing system where within a network of kiosk locations, users can rent and return bikes whenever they want. The team will combine historical usage patterns (date & time, holiday, working day) with weather data (season, temperature, humidity, etc) in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. Our proposed approach is to make use of the regression techniques covered in class to predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour. The project’s value opportunity relies on studying the mobility in the city and improving the bike sharing systems logistics and costs. Therefore, by optimizing its operation, more users might feel attracted to use sustainable and eco-friendly transportation systems. Additionally, as this service model is being implemented in many cities of the world, the analysis applied in this study can be extrapolated and applied to other places.
